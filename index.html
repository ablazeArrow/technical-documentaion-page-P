            We will build a small game during this tutorial.
            <strong
              >You might be tempted to skip it because you're not building games
              — but give it a chance.
            </strong>
            The techniques you'll learn in the tutorial are fundamental to
            building any React app, and mastering it will give you a deep
            understanding of React.
          </p>
          <p>The tutorial is divided into several sections:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Setup for the Tutorial will give you
              <strong>a starting point</strong>to follow the tutorial.
            </li>
            <li>
              Overview will teach you<strong>the fundamentals</strong>of React:
              components, props, and state.
            </li>
            <li>
              Completing the Game will teach you
              <strong>the most common techniques</strong>in React development.
            </li>
            <li>
              Adding Time Travel will give you<strong>a deeper insight</strong>
              into the unique strengths of React.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You don't have to complete all of the sections at once to get the
            value out of this tutorial. Try to get as far as you can — even if
            it's one or two sections.
          </p>

          <p>
            In this tutorial, we'll show how to build an interactive tic-tac-toe
            game with React.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can see what we'll be building here:
            <strong> Final Result</strong>
            If the code doesn't make sense to you, or if you are unfamiliar with
            the code's syntax, don't worry! The goal of this tutorial is to help
            you understand React and its syntax.
          </p>
          <p>
            We recommend that you check out the tic-tac-toe game before
            continuing with the tutorial. One of the features that you'll notice
            is that there is a numbered list to the right of the game's board.
            This list gives you a history of all of the moves that have occurred
            in the game, and it is updated as the game progresses.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can close the tic-tac-toe game once you're familiar with it.
            We'll be starting from a simpler template in this tutorial. Our next
            step is to set you up so that you can start building the game.

            We'll assume that you have some familiarity with HTML and
            JavaScript, but you should be able to follow along even if you're
            coming from a different programming language. We'll also assume that
            you're familiar with programming concepts like functions, objects,
            arrays, and to a lesser extent, classes.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you need to review JavaScript, we recommend reading this guide.
            Note that we're also using some features from ES6 — a recent version
            of JavaScript. In this tutorial, we're using arrow functions,
            classes, let, and const statements. You can use the Babel REPL to
            check what ES6 code compiles to.
          </p>

            There are two ways to complete this tutorial: you can either write
            the code in your browser, or you can set up a local development
            environment on your computer.
          </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Write_Code_in_the_Browser">
          <header><h2>Write Code in the Browser</h2></header>
          <p>This is the quickest way to get started!</p>
          <p>
            First, open this<strong> Starter Code</strong>in a new tab. The new
            tab should display an empty tic-tac-toe game board and React code.
            We will be editing the React code in this tutorial.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can now skip the second setup option, and go to the Overview
            section to get an overview of React.

          <p>
            This setup requires more work but allows you to complete the tutorial using an editor of your choice. Here are the steps to follow:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
                Make sure you have a recent version of Node.js installed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Follow the installation instructions for Create React App to make a new project. <pre><code>npx create-react-app my-app</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>Delete all files in the src/ folder of the new project 
<pre><code>
cd my-app
cd src

# If you're using a Mac or Linux:
rm -f *

# Or, if you're on Windows:
del *

# Then, switch back to the project folder
cd ..</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>Add a file named index.css in the src/ folder with this CSS code.</li>
            <li>Add a file named index.js in the src/ folder with this JS code.</li>
            <li>Add these three lines to the top of index.js in the src/ folder:
<pre>
<code>
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import './index.css';
</code>
</pre>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Now if you run npm start in the project folder and open http://localhost:3000 in the browser, you should see an empty tic-tac-toe field.</p>
          <p>
            We recommend following these instructions to configure syntax highlighting for your editor.

            <header><h2>What Is React</h2></header>
            <p>
                React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.
            </p>
            <p>React has a few different kinds of components, but we'll start with React.Component subclasses:
<pre><code>
    class ShoppingList extends React.Component {
        render() {
            return (
            &lt;div className="shopping-list">
            &lt;h1>Shopping List for {this.props.name}</h1>
            &lt;ul>
            &lt;li&gt; Instagram</li>
            &lt;li&gt; WhatsApp</li>
            &lt;li&gt; Oculus</li>
            &lt;/ul>
            &lt;/div>
            );
        }
    }                      
</code></pre>
                // Example usage: &lt;ShoppingList name="Mark" />
            </p>
            <p>
                We'll get to the funny XML-like tags soon. We use components to tell React what we want to see on the screen. When our data changes, React will efficiently update and re-render our components.
            </p>
            <p>Here, ShoppingList is a <strong>React component class,</strong> or<strong>React component type.</strong>A component takes in parameters, called props (short for “properties”), and returns a hierarchy of views to display via the render method.</p>
            <p>The render method returns a description of what you want to see on the screen. React takes the description and displays the result. In particular, render returns a <strong>React element,</strong>which is a lightweight description of what to render. Most React developers use a special syntax called “JSX” which makes these structures easier to write. The &lt;div /&gt; syntax is transformed at build time to React.createElement('div'). The example above is equivalent to:</p>
<p>
<pre><code>
    return React.createElement('div', {className: 'shopping-list'},
        React.createElement('h1', /* ... h1 children ... */),
        React.createElement('ul', /* ... ul children ... */)
    );
</code>
</pre>
            See full expanded version.
           </p>
           <p>If you're curious, createElement() is described in more detail in the API reference, but we won't be using it in this tutorial. Instead, we will keep using JSX.</p>
           <p>JSX comes with the full power of JavaScript. You can put any JavaScript expressions within braces inside JSX. Each React element is a JavaScript object that you can store in a variable or pass around in your program.</p>
           <p>
            The ShoppingList component above only renders built-in DOM components like 
            &lt;div /&gt; and  &lt;li /&gt;. But you can compose and render custom React components too. For example, we can now refer to the whole shopping list by writing &lt;ShoppingList  /&gt;. Each React component is encapsulated and can operate independently; this allows you to build complex UIs from simple components.
           </p>

          <section class="main-section" id="Inspecting_the_Starter_Code">
            <header><h2>Inspecting the Starter Code</h2></header>
            
            <p>If you're going to work on the tutorial 
                <strong> in your browser,</strong>open this code in a new tab: 
                <strong>Starter Code.</strong> If you're going to work on the tutorial
                <strong>locally,</strong>instead open src/index.js in your project folder (you have already touched this file during the setup).
            </p>
            <p>This Starter Code is the base of what we're building. We've provided the CSS styling so that you only need to focus on learning React and programming the tic-tac-toe game.</p>
            <ul>By inspecting the code, you'll notice that we have three React components:
                <li>Square</li>
                <li>Board</li>
                <li>Game</li>                
            </ul>
            <p>The Square component renders a single and the Board renders 9 squares. The Game component renders a board with placeholder values which we'll modify later. There are currently no interactive components.
